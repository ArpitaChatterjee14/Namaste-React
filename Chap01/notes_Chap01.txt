React is a library, Carousel is a JS Library

We can write normal Hello World project using HTML as well as JS using DOM Manipulation.

Browser has it's own API. We can inject React into our code using CDN in script tag with crossorigin attribute

Shortest progrem of React is just to inject CDN into empty HTML using script tag

React is invented by Facebook developers

React is not limited to Browsers. There is React Native for mobile apps. React DOM is the web version of React.

Any createElement from React is basically an object

There is only one root and one render methods

const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React"); =>  curly brace takes property.(props)

<div id="root">Not Rendered</div>
Anything inside div will be overwritten by React. Not Rendered will only be seen in website when React is unable to override it with it's createElement.
root is not configured properly so React is unable to inject into root.

If we put React CDN below the React script, it won't work and say that React is not defined in console.

createElement like h1,div in React etc => create the root element from getelement by id root in React => render the React element into root

Passing multiple children into a component is by passing array of elements.

We can use JSX instead of createElement.
